A few logic in this code such as: combine mousedown and mouseenter events, the use of button/mode activation, were inspired by #michalosman on github. Though this project tried to implement such logic in a different way as much as possible. 


Other things to note: the combination of mousedown and mouseenter events doesn't work sometimes, it is very easy to notice. In this case, we will simply click the left mouse button one more time, and the problem is fixed (temporarily). I will look into this issue more in the future.
