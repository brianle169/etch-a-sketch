# etch-a-sketch
An online etch-a-sketch app.
A few logic in this code such as: combine <mousedown> and <mouseenter> events, the use of button/mode activation, were inspired by #michalosman on github. Though this project tried to implement such logic in a different way as much as possible. 
Other things to note: the combination of <mousedown> and <mouseenter> events doesn't work sometimes, it is very easy to notice. In this case, we will simply click the left mouse button one more time, and the problem is fixed (temporarily). I will look into this issue more in the future.
